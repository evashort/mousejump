,"Turns off processing of prefix characters. Normally, DrawTextEx interprets
the ampersand (&) mnemonic-prefix character as a directive to underscore the
character that follows, and the double-ampersand (&&) mnemonic-prefix
characters as a directive to print a single ampersand. By specifying
T_NOPREFIX, this processing is turned off. Compare with DT_HIDEPREFIX and
DT_PREFIXONLY"
